                Broccoli is a cool-season crop. Grow broccoli so that it comes to harvest when temperatures average no
                more than 75°F (23°C) each day.
                You can plant a spring and early summer crop in late winter or early spring. Plant a fall or winter crop
                in mid to late or summer or early fall.

            <p>
                Broccoli is a hardy biennial grown as a cool-season annual. It grows 18 to 36 inches (45-91cm) tall and
                has broad, thick leaves and a thick main stalk. Broccoli forms single or multiple flower “heads ” of
                tiny blue-green flower buds. The flower heads are eaten before they bloom; buds open to tiny yellow
                flowers. Broccoli will bolt and go to seed in warm temperatures or when daylight hours lengthen.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Grow Broccoli</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Broccoli</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Broccoli is a cool-weather crop that must come to harvest before temperatures rise consistently
                    above 75°F (24°C).</li>
                <li>Start broccoli seed indoors 5 to 6 weeks before the last frost in spring.</li>
                <li>Transplant broccoli seedlings to the garden 2 to 3 weeks before the last frost in spring after
                    hardening seedlings off for 4 days.</li>
                <li>In mild-winter regions, start seeds indoors in late summer and set them in the garden in autumn for
                    winter harvest.</li>
                <li>Whether that is too cold or too warm will cause broccoli to go to seed without forming heads.</li>
                <li>In cold-winter, short-season regions start broccoli in summer for fall harvest.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Broccoli</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Broccoli grows best in compost-rich, well-drained soil with a soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8.</li>
                <li>Broccoli grows best where air temperatures range between 45° and 75°F (7.2-24°C).</li>
                <li>Broccoli is frost hardy and can tolerate temperatures as low as 20°F (-6.7°C).</li>
                <li>In regions where there is heavy rain or sandy soil, aged-compost should be added to the soil to
                    supplement soil nitrogen.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Broccoli</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Plant transplants that are 4 to 6 weeks old with four or five true leaves.</li>
                <li>Leggy transplants or transplants with crooked stems can be planted up to their first leaves so that
                    they will not grow top-heavy.</li>
                <li>Plant seedlings 18 to 24 inches (45-61cm) apart in rows 24 to 36 inches (61-91cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Plant seeds and transplants at the same time for succession crops or plant early and midseason
                    varieties at the same time.</li>
                <li>Sow seed ½ inch deep and 3 inches (7.6cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Transplant thinned seedlings to another part of the garden.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Broccoli</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep soil moist during the growing season.</li>
                <li>Decrease watering when plants approach maturity.</li>
                <li>Water broccoli at the base of the plant.</li>
                <li>Side dress plants with well-aged compost at planting time and again at midseason</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Broccoli can be attacked by cutworms, cabbage loopers (preceded by small yellow and white moths),
                    and imported cabbage worms.</li>
                <li>Control these pests by handpicking them off of plants or by spraying with Bacillus thuringiensis.
                </li>
                <li>Broccoli is susceptible to cabbage family diseases including yellows, clubroot, and downy mildew.
                </li>
                <li>Plant disease-resistant varieties, rotate crops each year, and keep the garden free of debris to cut
                    back the incidence of disease.</li>
                <li>Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Broccoli</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Broccoli grown from seed will come to harvest in 100 to 150 days.</li>
                <li>Grown from transplants broccoli will come to harvest in 55 to 80 days.</li>
                <li>Cut buds when they are still green and tight.</li>
                <li>Cut the central head with five to six inches of stem.</li>
                <li>Leave the base of the plant and some outer leaves to encourage new heads on secondary shoots.</li>
                <li>Heads that have begun to open showing small yellow flowers are past the eating stage.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storing Brocccoli</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Broccoli will keep in the refrigerator for up to one week or frozen after blanching for up to 3
                    months.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Different Types of Broccoli</h3>
