                Horses vary in size, body shape and temperament. Although their working lives (the period when they can be ridden or driven) may be much shorter,
                they can live well into their thirties or longer! Learn everything there is to know about caring for your horses here!
            </p>
            <div class="horse-img"></div>
            <p>
            Horses can be easy and rewarding to care for provided that you make sure to follow these steps:
             At the very least a horse needs:
            </p>
                <ol>
                <li>   Unlimited supply of fresh clean water, heated if necessary in sub-freezing temperatures.</li>
                    <li>Access to salt.</li>
                <li>    Shelter from wet or wintry weather and shade in summer.</li>
                <li>    A dry clean area to lie down.</li>
                    <li>    Daily monitoring for injury or illness.</li>
                    <li>    Companionship, either with another horse, donkey, mule or pony or another animal such as a sheep or goat</li>
                </ol>

            <h1>FEEDING YOUR HORSE</h1>
            <div class="feed-img"></div>
            <p>
            Good horse care includes quality roughage. While grass is a horse's natural food, it's not always available, and may not be adequate in some situations.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
            For starters not all plants that grow in pastures are good for your horse, so it is important to know which plants
            are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/plants-toxic-to-horses-4121978"> toxic for your horse</a> so that you can eradicate them from the field you plan to leave your horse to graze on.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3> All About Hay! </h3>
            <p> When good pasture grass is not available, hay is the single most important source.  In its most basic form, hay is dried grasses and plants. There are a few key ideas to keep in mind when feeding your horse hay:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly you want to check if your horse breed can survive on hay alone or if it needs grain concentrates or pellets to supplement its diet.</li>
                <li>When buying hay make sure that it was baled properly.  If hay isn't baled properly, molds can grow causing dusty hay. </li>
                <li>Just how much your horse will need will depend on its weight. According to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, a full-grown horse should eat about 12 to 15 pounds (5.4 to 6.8 kg) of hay a day.1 That is 1.5 percent to 3 percent of its body weight, if it weighs about 1,000 pounds (450 kg). But, some draft horses, especially ones that work hard, will need rather more than the normal ratio of hay. This is why it is so important to regularly monitor your horse’s condition, </li>
                <li> Like any food, hay loses some of its nutrients the longer it sits. There are no 'best before' dates on hay. However, as a general rule of thumb it is best to consume Hay within a year of when it was made</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Finally: it is important to remember that
                fresh clean water should be available to horses at all times. Insufficient water can contribute to poor health. Chronic dehydration can cause a horse to lose weight and be in poor condition. Dehydration can be deadly as lack of water can cause impactions leading to colics, especially during the winter months, when a horse's diet may consist almost solely of dry hay.  Additionally, unhygenic water and watering equipment such as troughs and buckets can also harbor bacteria or viruses that can make your horse sick.

            <h1>GROOMING YOUR HORSE/HOOF MAINTANANCE</h1>
            <div class="grooming-img"></div>
            <p>
                Proper grooming of your horse is extremely important for its health and well being. Much like human beings, improper grooming and care of a horse's body can lead to
                a rapid deterioration of its health!
                 Grooming also encourages good blood circulation and gives you the chance to check over your horse's body for any external wounds, especially the parts of
                the body that will come into contact with tack. Stable horses should be groomed on a regular basis, always before putting their tack on and after removing it.
            </p>
            <br><br>
              <p><strong>How to Groom a Horse</strong></p>
            <p>
                Here’s what to do to groom your horse and maintain its health! :
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with the hooves: hold the hoof and with the hoof pick pry out any dirt, manure, or grit lodged in the frog or sole of the foot, picking from the heel to the toes.
                    Check for any injury and signs of thrush, grease heel, or other problems, and take note of any cracks in the wall of the hoof, so you can consult with your farrier as
                    to what should be done. Gently place the foot back down on the ground and continue until all four feet are done .</li>
                <li>Next is the curry comb: use the comb across horse's coat, moving it in circular motions against the natural direction of the fur.</li>
                <li> After that use the brush over your horse's coat, to brush off any dirt or dust that the curry comb might have brought to the surface.</li>
                <li>After that, comb its mane and tail: Start with a mane comb or brush at the bottom of the strands and brush downward in sections until you can smoothly comb from the top to the bottom.
                    When brushing the tail, stand to one side and pull the tail gently over to you, making sure you are out of the way should the horse kick. </li>
                <li>Finally, with a soft damp cloth, gently clean your horse’s muzzle and eyes. A bit of tearing at the corner of the eye is not uncommon, but take note of excess tearing, redness,
                    or swelling. Eye infections need to be treated promptly. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Finally be sure remember to pay attention to your horse's behaviour while grooming. Some horses may be more delicate or fussy than others about having things like their ears or belly handled, so go slowly and be careful not to pinch or pull hairs.
                If while brushing him, your horse reacts by laying back his ears or swishing his tail in agitation, he is telling you that the brushing is too vigorous and that you should be more
                delicate.
            </p>
            <h3>TRAINING</h3>
            <div class="training-img"></div>
            <p>Lastly, regardless if you plan on using your horse to ride him or for draft, it is essential to ensure that your horse gets a regular amount
                of exercise each day, and has some time each day in a large field or pasture so that he can run and play with his fellow horses/animal companions.
             As a minimum form of exercise, some daily walking is required; 15 or 20 minutes should do the trick. </p>
           <p>When riding, the amount of exercise must be governed by how fit the horse is, and a daily routine should be established to guarantee that fitness is attained. Getting a horse fit requires a gradual increase within the exercise regimen. Once the horse is fully fit, reassessment of the required amount of exercise can be determined by basic common sense. For example, a horse that has worked hard one day will not need an extensive work session the next day; a 20 minute walk to work the stiffness out of the joints or take away any swelling in the legs is all that is necessary. Keeping a horse in top condition requires about two hours of exercise every day,
               whether it be led or ridden. To keep the back and girth regions toned, the horse should be saddled and ridden regularly.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p> Regardless of your horse's breed or type of work it does, it is optimal to create an exercise plan for him to ensure a healthy and balanced exercise routine.
            Whilst the types of exercises can vary depending on your horse's age, breed and starting level of health, in general the exercise routine for your horse will take
                 are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bhs.org.uk/advice-and-information/horse-care/horse-health-and-fitness"> this form</a>.
                Before proceeding to starting a particular exercise/training routine, it is always recommended to talk to your horses's vet first, to ensure that the routine is appropriate
                for your particular horse.</p>
            <h3> ESENTIAL HORSE CARE</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Carrots need a location that receives full sunlight, though they can tolerate partial shade, too.</li>
                <li>As discussed above, soil must be loose, sandy or loamy, and airy so that carrot roots can easily push down through the soil.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>HOW TO PLANT CARROTS</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>We recommend sowing seeds directly in the garden (or wherever you plan to grow them) rather than transplanting. Carrots do not like to have their roots disturbed. </li>
                <li>Sow ¼ inch deep, 2 to 3 inches apart in rows 1 foot apart</li>
                <p><strong>Tip: Try to distribute seed in an even fashion so that seeds don’t grow together. Use a seed-sower or thin vigorously to the right spacing.</strong></p>
                <br><br>
                <li>Keep the soil moist with frequent shallow waterings. For small carrot seeds to germinate, the soil mustn’t form a hard crust on top; cover with a layer of vermiculite or fine compost to prevent a crust from forming. (If you put your finger in the ground, it should be moist, but not wet, to the middle knuckle.)</li>
                <li>Carrots are sometimes slow to germinate. They may take 2 to 3 weeks to show any sign of life, so don’t panic if your carrots don’t appear right away!</li>
                <p><strong>Tip: To help keep track of where they were planted, mix carrot seeds with quick-germinating radish seeds or sow radish seeds in rows between carrot rows. The radishes will grow quickly and by the time the carrots really start to grow, the radishes can be harvested.</strong></p>
