                Horses vary in size, body shape and temperament. Although their working lives (the period when they can be ridden or driven) may be much shorter,
                they can live well into their thirties or longer! Learn everything there is to know about caring for your horses here!

            <p>
            Horses can be easy and rewarding to care for provided that you make sure to follow these steps:
             At the very least a horse needs:
            </p>
                <ol type>
                <li>Pasture free from hazards such as holes, rusty farm machinery and loose wire fences.</li>
                <li>     Safe fencing such as wooden, plastic, or vinyl rails, or mesh wire fencing.</li>
                <li>     Grass for grazing or equivalent amount of good quality hay.</li>
                <li>   Unlimited supply of fresh clean water, heated if necessary in sub-freezing temperatures.</li>
                    <li>Access to salt.</li>
                <li>    Shelter from wet or wintry weather and shade in summer.</li>
                <li>    A dry clean area to lie down.</li>
                    <li>    Daily monitoring for injury or illness.</li>
                    <li>    Companionship, either with another horse, donkey, mule or pony or another animal such as a sheep or goat</li>
                </ol>


            <h1>FEEDING YOUR HORSE</h1>
            <p>
Good horse care includes quality roughage. While grass is a horse's natural food, it's not always available, and may not be adequate in some situations.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
            For starters snot all plants that grow in pastures are good for your horse, so it is important to know which plants
            are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/plants-toxic-to-horses-4121978"> toxic for your horse</a> so that you can eradicate them from the field you plan to leave your horse to graze on.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2> All About Hay! </h2>
            <p> When good pasture grass is not available, hay is the single most important source.  In its most basic form, hay is dried grasses and plants. There are a few key ideas to keep in mind when feeding your horse hay:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly you want to check if your horse breed can survive on hay alone or if it needs grain concetrates or pellets to supplement its diet.</li>
                <li>When buying hay make sure that it was baled properly.  If hay isn't baled properly, molds can grow causing dusty hay. </li>
                <li>Just how much your horse will need will depend on its weight. According to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, a full-grown horse should eat about 12 to 15 pounds (5.4 to 6.8 kg) of hay a day.1 That is 1.5 percent to 3 percent of its body weight, if it weighs about 1,000 pounds (450 kg). But, some draft horses, especially ones that work hard, will need rather more than the normal ratio of hay. This is why it is so important to regularly monitor your horse’s condition, </li>
                <li> Like any food, hay loses some of its nutrients the longer it sits. There are no 'best before' dates on hay. However, as a general rule of thumb it is best to consume Hay within a year of when it was made</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Finally: it is important to remember that
                fresh clean water should be available to horses at all times. Insufficient water can contribute to poor health. Chronic dehydration can cause a horse to lose weight and be in poor condition. Dehydration can be deadly as lack of water can cause impactions leading to colics, especially during the winter months, when a horse's diet may consist almost solely of dry hay.  Additionally, unhygenic water and watering equipment such as troughs and buckets can also harbor bacteria or viruses that can make your horse sick.

            <h3>PLANTING</h3>

            <p><strong>WHEN TO PLANT CARROTS</strong></p>
            <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>For a summer harvest, sow seeds outdoors 3 to 5 weeks before the last spring frost date. Find your local frost dates here.
                </li>
                <br><br>
                <p><strong>To ensure a continuous harvest, plant a new round of seeds every 3 weeks through late spring.</strong></p>
                <br><br>
                <li>For a fall harvest, sow seeds in mid- to late summer—starting about 10 weeks before your first fall frost.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>HOOSING AND PREPARING A PLANTING SITE</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Carrots need a location that receives full sunlight, though they can tolerate partial shade, too.</li>
                <li>As discussed above, soil must be loose, sandy or loamy, and airy so that carrot roots can easily push down through the soil.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>HOW TO PLANT CARROTS</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>We recommend sowing seeds directly in the garden (or wherever you plan to grow them) rather than transplanting. Carrots do not like to have their roots disturbed. </li>
                <li>Sow ¼ inch deep, 2 to 3 inches apart in rows 1 foot apart</li>
                <p><strong>Tip: Try to distribute seed in an even fashion so that seeds don’t grow together. Use a seed-sower or thin vigorously to the right spacing.</strong></p>
                <br><br>
                <li>Keep the soil moist with frequent shallow waterings. For small carrot seeds to germinate, the soil mustn’t form a hard crust on top; cover with a layer of vermiculite or fine compost to prevent a crust from forming. (If you put your finger in the ground, it should be moist, but not wet, to the middle knuckle.)</li>
                <li>Carrots are sometimes slow to germinate. They may take 2 to 3 weeks to show any sign of life, so don’t panic if your carrots don’t appear right away!</li>
                <p><strong>Tip: To help keep track of where they were planted, mix carrot seeds with quick-germinating radish seeds or sow radish seeds in rows between carrot rows. The radishes will grow quickly and by the time the carrots really start to grow, the radishes can be harvested.</strong></p>

            <h3>CARE</h3>
            <div class="caring-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Gently mulch carrots to retain moisture, speed germination, and block the sun from hitting the roots directly.</li>
                <li>When seedlings are an inch tall, thin so that they stand 3 to 4 inches apart. Snip tops with scissors instead of pulling them out to prevent damage to the fragile roots of the remaining plants.</li>
                <li>Water at least one inch (about ½ gallon per square foot) per week to start, then two inches as roots mature.</li>
                <li>Weed diligently, but be careful not to disturb the young carrots’ roots while doing so.</li>
                <li>Fertilize with a low-nitogen but high-potassium and -phosphate fertilizer 5 to 6 weeks after sowing. (Note that excess nitrogen in the soil promotes top, or foliage, growth—not roots.)</li>
                <li>See more tips for growing carrots.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>PESTS/DISEASES</h3>
            <div class="pest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Carrot rust flies</li>
                <li>Root-knot nematodes</li>
                <li>Black (Itersonilia) canker</li>
                <li>Flea Beetles</li>
                <li>Wireworms</li>
                <li><strong>Aster Yellow Disease</strong>will cause shortened and discolored carrot tops and hairy roots. This disease is spread by pests as they feed from plant to plant. Keep weeds down and invest in a control plan for pests such as leafhoppers. This disease has the ability to overwinter.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>HARVEST/STORAGE</h1>
            <h3>HOW AND WHEN TO HARVEST CARROTS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Generally, the smaller the carrot, the better the taste.</li>
                <li>Harvest whenever desired maturity or size is reached. Carrots should be about as wide as your thumb or at least ½ of an inch in diameter.</li>
                <li>If you’re growing carrots in the spring and early summer, harvest before daily temperatures get too hot, as the heat can cause carrot roots to grow fibrous.</li>
                <li>Carrots taste much better after one or more frosts. (A frost encourages the plant to start storing energy—sugars—in its root for later use.) Following the first hard frost in the fall, cover carrot tops with an 18-inch layer of shredded leaves to preserve them for harvesting later.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong>Carrots are biennial. If you fail to harvest and leave the carrots in the ground, the tops will flower and proeduce seeds in the next year.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>HOW DO YOU STORE FRESH CARROTS?</h1>
            <div class="fresh-carrot-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>To store freshly-harvested carrots, twist or cut off all but ½ inch of the tops, scrub off any dirt under cold running water, and air-dry. Seal in airtight plastic bags, and refrigerate. If you simply put fresh carrots in the refrigerator, they’ll go limp in a few hours.</li>
                <li>You may leave mature carrots in the soil for temporary storage if the ground will not freeze and pests aren’t a problem.</li>
                <li>Carrots can also be stored in tubs of moist sand or dry sawdust in a cool, dry area.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>VARIETIES</h3>
            <p>Carrots come in a rainbow of colors, sizes, and shapes.</p>
            <div class="carrot-colors-img"></div>
            <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Little Finger:</strong>heirloom; a small Nantes type of carrot only 4 inches long and one inch thick; good for containers. </li>
                <li><strong>Nantes:</strong>cylindrical (not tapered); 6 to 7 inches; exceptionally sweet; crisp texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Bolero:</strong>slightly tapered; 7 to 8 inches; resists most leaf pests and blights.</li>
                <li><strong>Thumberline:</strong>heirloom; round carrot, good for clumpy or clay soil and containers.</li>
                <li><strong>Danvers:</strong>classic heirloom; 6 to 8 inches long, that tapers at the end and has a rich, dark orange color; suited to heavy soil.</li>
                <li>For unusual color, try heirloom <strong>Red Cored Chantenay</strong> and bright <strong>Solar Yellow</strong>.</li>
