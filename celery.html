                Celery is a cool-weather crop. It requires 16 weeks of cool weather to come to harvest.
            </p>
            <div class="celery-img"></div>
            <p>
                In cool spring and summer regions, plant celery in early spring. In warm spring and summer regions,
                plant celery in late summer for harvest in late autumn or early winter.
                Celery is a hardy biennial grown as an annual. It has a rosette of 12- to 18-inch (30-45cm) stalks,
                topped with divided leaves. Celery is grown for its stalks, leaves, and seeds.
                Plant 5 plants per household member.

            <h1>How to Grow Celery</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Celery</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Celery is a cool-weather crop. It requires 16 weeks of cool weather to come to harvest.</li>
                <li>Start celery seed indoors 8 to 10 weeks before the last frost in spring.</li>
                <li>Set transplants in the garden 2 to 3 weeks before the average last frost date when seedlings have 5
                    to 6 leaves.</li>
                <li>(To delay transplanting time and slow growth, cut seedlings down to 3 inches (7.6cm) tall and then
                    allow them to grow on.) Cold weather will inhibit growth as will warm weather. </li>
                <li>Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) for more than 12 hours may cause celery to bolt.</li>
                <li>In cool spring and summer regions, plant celery in early spring.</li>
                <li>In warm spring and summer regions, plant celery in late summer for harvest in late autumn or early
                    winter.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Celery</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grow celery in compost-rich, moisture-retentive soil that borders on wet but still drains.</li>
                <li>Celery prefers soil with a pH between 5.8 and 6.8. </li>
                <li>Celery has a low tolerance for heat and prefers a cool.</li>
                <li>Cloudy location where growing temperatures range between 60°F and 70°F (15-21°C).</li>
                <li>Plant celery where the growing season offers 4 months of cool weather.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Celery</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Sow celery seed ¼ to ½ inch deep, 6 to 10 inches (15-25cm) apart; space rows 24 inches (61cm) apart.
                </li>
                <li>Transplant seedlings started indoors into trenches 3 to 4 inches (7.6-10cm) deep set 6 to 10 inches
                    (15-25cm) apart.</li>
                <li>As plants grow mound up soil around the stems to blanch them.</li>
                <li>Plant self-blanching celery in blocks 6 to 12 inches (15-30cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Planting closer will give a higher yield but more slender stalks.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Celery</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep celery well-watered during all phases of growth. Lack of water will slow growth.</li>
                <li>Cause stalks to become stringy, and encourage plants to send up flower stalks.</li>
                <li>Celery is a heavy feeder.</li>
                <li>Add aged-compost to planting beds before planting and side-dress plants with compost at midseason.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Celery usually encounters no serious pest problems but can be attacked by celery leaf miner and
                    slugs (during blanching).</li>
                <li>Pink rot, black heart, and blight can attack celery.</li>
                <li>Make sure there are adequate magnesium and calcium in the soil to discourage these diseases.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Celery</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Time from planting to harvest is 100 to 130 days from transplants about 20 days longer from seed.
                </li>
                <li>A 10-foot (3m) row should yield about 20 heads of celery.</li>
                <li>Start harvesting before the first hard frost when the head is about 2 to 3 inches (5-7.6cm)in
                    diameter at the base.</li>
                <li>Cut off the head at or slightly below the soil level.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storing Celery</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Celery will keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</li>
                <li>Leaves cut for use as an herb will keep in the refrigerator for up to one week.</li>
                <li>Celery can be dried, canned, and frozen.</li>
                <li>Seeds can be used as an herb.</li>
            </ol>
