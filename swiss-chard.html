                Chard, also called Swiss chard, grows best in the cooler time of the year. Sow chard in the garden 2 to
                4 weeks after all frost has passed in spring. Grow Swiss chard again in autumn,
            </p>

                Chard is a member of the beet family grown for its rosette of large, crinkly green leaves on thick red
                or white stalks. Plants can grow to 16 inches tall and leaves and stalks can be harvested several times
                over the course of a season on a cut-and-come-again schedule. Plant 2 to 3 chard plants per household
                member.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Grow Swiss Chard</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Swiss Chard</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chard grows best in cool temperatures; high temperatures will slow down leaf production.</li>
                <li>Sow chard in the garden 2 to 4 weeks after all frost has passed in spring.</li>
                <li>To get an early start, sow chard indoors as early as 3 to 4 weeks before the average last frost date
                    in spring for transplanting out when plants are 3 to 4 inches (7-10cm) tall.</li>
                <li>Plant chard also in summer for a fall harvest. Once established chard will tolerate heat and frost.
                </li>
                <li>In mild-winter climates, chard can be grown through the winter.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Swiss Chard</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grow chard in full sun; chard will tolerate partial shade.</li>
                <li>Chard grows best in well-worked, well-drained soil rich in organic matter, although chard does not
                    favor soil that is too acidic.</li>
                <li>Chard grows best in a soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Swiss Chard</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Sow chard seed Â½ inch deep from 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Thin successful seedlings from 8 to 12 inches (20-30cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Space rows 18 to 24 inches (45-61cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Chard grows from seed cluster (several seeds to a cluster, similar to beets).</li>
                <li>Clusters are likely to produce several seedlings so thin to the strongest seedling once plants are 3
                    inches (7cm) tall.</li>
                <li>Cut the weaker seedlings off at soil level with small scissors.</li>
                <li>Chard can grow crowded, but leaves will be smaller.</li>
                <li>Crowded plants may tend to bolt and go to seed more quickly.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Swiss Chard</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep chard evenly moist for quick, tender growth.</li>
                <li>Prepare planting beds with well-aged compost in advance of sowing.</li>
                <li>Side dress chard with aged compost at midseason.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Chard has no serious disease problems.</li>
                <li>Aphids and leaf miners will attack chard.</li>
                <li>Control aphids by pinching out the affected leaves or hose them away with a blast of water.</li>
                <li>Leaf miners feed on the inside of leaf surfaces.</li>
                <li>Remove leaves with significant leaf miner damage and look underneath leaves for a row of pearl-white
                    eggs; destroy them.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Swiss Chard</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Chard will be ready for harvest in 55 to 60 days from sowing.</li>
                <li>Pick outside leaves as early as three inches long but before leaves grow to10 inches long.</li>
                <li>Older leaves will have an earthy flavor.</li>
                <li>Harvest chard on a cut-and-come-again schedule; remove a few outside leaves at a time.</li>
                <li>If you harvest the whole plant, cut it back to about 3 inches (7cm) above the soil and it will grow
                    back.</li>
                <li>Chare that overwinters can be harvested again the second year.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storing Swiss Chard</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chard will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks.</li>
                <li>Remove the stem and chard will keep in the freezer for up to 6 months.</li>
            </ol>
