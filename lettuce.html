                Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an annual plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is most often grown as a
                leaf vegetable, but sometimes for its stem and seeds.
                Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups,
                sandwiches and wraps; it can also be grilled.
                One variety, the celtuce (asparagus lettuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or
                cooked. In addition to its main use as a leafy green,
                it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. Europe
                and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce,
                but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. World
                production of lettuce and chicory for 2017 was 27 million tonnes,
                56% of which came from China.
            </p>
            <div class="lettuce-img"></div>
            <p>
                Generally grown as a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low
                temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly.
                It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and
                bacterial diseases.
                L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the genus Lactuca.
                Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds,
                biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.
                Lettuce is an easy-to-grow annual vegetable. Considered a spring and fall crop, lettuce thrives when
                temperatures are between 60 to 70 degrees F. Many varieties reach maturity in as little as 30 days, and
                some can even be harvested much earlier as microgreens. From your garden beds to patio containers, these
                simple steps will give you a bountiful supply of crisp salad greens throughout multiple seasons.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Grow Lettuce</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Lettuce</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lettuce loves cool weather. You can begin planting leaf, romaine and butterhead lettuce as soon as
                    the soil can be worked in the spring. </li>
                <li>Cabbage grows best where the soil pH is between 6.5 and 6.8.</li>
                <li>Depending on the variety, lettuce germinates in temperatures between 40 to 85 degrees F. If you
                    plant lettuce in successive plantings, with 10 to 14 days in between, you’ll have an extended
                    harvest.</li>
                <li>To prevent summer bolt, stop planting one month before warm summer temperatures start. Begin
                    planting fall lettuce in late summer so it reaches maturity when the fall air is cool.</li>
                <li>Water regularly by giving plants 1 to 1.5 inches of water weekly.</li>
                <li>Head lettuce is usually started indoors or in a cold frame and transplanted in the spring after the
                    last frost date.</li>
                <li>Growing lettuce from seedlings for early spring transplant is a good way to get a head start on the
                    growing season.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Lettuce</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The ideal lettuce growing location for spring and fall is in a spot that receives full sun. If you
                    plan on growing lettuce during the summer or in warm planting zones, partial shade can provide
                    protection from the heat.</li>
                <li>Growing lettuce from seed in late summer may require generous artificial shade to help cool the soil
                    for germination.</li>
                <li>Once days become cooler, the shade can be removed to give plenty of sunlight to young lettuce
                    plants.</li>
                <li>Lettuce grows best in loose, cool soil with good drainage. The addition of organic materials, such
                    as compost or manure, will increase drainage, provide essential nutrients and improve your lettuce
                    growing conditions.</li>
                <li>Sow seed outdoors when the soil can be worked in spring.</li>
                <li>If you’ve had trouble with lettuce growth, consider purchasing a soil test kit. Lettuce is sensitive
                    to low pH. The addition of lime can help bring the pH to at least 6.0.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Lettuce</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>It doesn’t take much work to grow lettuce from seeds. Lettuce seeds are often quite small and only
                    require a planting depth of ¼ to ½ inch deep.</li>
                <li>Growing lettuce in rows gives your garden a traditional look. Consider alternating rows of green and
                    red lettuce for a whimsical touch.</li>
                <li>How far apart to plant lettuce depends on the type of lettuce you’re planting. When sowing seeds
                    directly into the soil, you should plant approximately 10 seeds per foot. Space your rows 12 to 18
                    inches apart.</li>
                <li>Thin leaf lettuce seedlings to 4 inches apart. Romaine and butterhead lettuce seedlings require 6 to
                    8 inches between each plant.</li>
                <li>Removed seedlings can be transplanted or eaten as delicious, tender microgreens.</li>
                <li>Head lettuce is usually grown from seeds started indoors during warm weather for a fall garden.</li>
                <li>Transplant head lettuce in rows 12 to 18 inches apart with 10 to 12 inches between each plant.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Lettuce</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>You don’t need lettuce to develop deep roots. In fact, you want to encourage leaf growth over
                    rooting.</li>
                <li>Lettuce watering should be light, frequent and consistent. The goal is to simply keep the soil
                    moist.</li>
                <li>Avoid watering too often – overwatering leads to root rot, disease and stunted growth.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Aphids can easily destroy a lettuce patch. Leaves curl and wilt as nutrients and water are sucked
                    away. Aphids also spread disease and create mold issues.</li>
                <li>You’ll find these annoying little white pests hiding on the undersides of lettuce leaves. </li>
                <li>There isn’t a systemic insecticide to control aphids, so your best option is to encourage natural
                    predators, such as lady beetles, or to apply a horticultural soap or neem oil.</li>
                <li>Snails, slugs and caterpillars also love lettuce. Insecticides are one option, but traps, organic
                    bait and hand picking provide organic solutions to these common pests.</li>
                <li>If you notice your lettuce beginning to brown and curl, it could be suffering from a physiological
                    condition known as tipburn.</li>
                <li>Tipburn is often seen on lettuce when moisture is not consistent. Simply trim the browned lettuce
                    and begin a consistent watering schedule.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Lettuce</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>You don’t have to worry about how to pick lettuce – it’s one of the simplest vegetables to harvest.
                </li>
                <li>Most lettuce can be harvested between 30 to 70 days after planting.</li>
                <li>When to harvest lettuce depends on the variety and what it will be used for. Really, timing is based
                    on individual preference.</li>
                <li>Once your lettuce reaches the size you want, it’s ready! Harvesting lettuce in the morning gives you
                    the best flavor.</li>
                <li>Knowing how to harvest leaf lettuce is easy. You can either cut the entire bundle off at ground
                    level, or you can remove just a few leaves at a time.</li>
                <li>Romaine, butterhead and head lettuce are easily cut off near ground level.</li>
                <li>If you harvest every other lettuce plant, you give the remaining plants room to continue growing.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Growing Different Types of Lettuce</h3>
            <div class="lettuce-types"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>There are four popular types of lettuce grown:</li>
                <li>Romaine Lettuce</li>
                <li>Butterhead Lettuce</li>
                <li>Head Lettuce</li>
                <li>Loose-leaf Lettuce</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Growing Green and Red Leaf Lettuce</h3>
            <div class="green-red-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Leaf lettuce varieties are the easiest lettuces to grow. Although many people assume red leaf
                    lettuce is grown differently, growing red leaf lettuce is exactly the same as growing green lettuce.
                </li>
                <li>You can grow leaf lettuce in rows for nice bundles of loose leaf lettuce, or you can sow it thickly
                    in a garden bed or container for harvest as young, tender lettuce. </li>
                <li>By harvesting leaf lettuce through trimming it a few inches above the soil, you can get two to three
                    harvests from one planting. Popular cultivars include Red Sails, Tango and Slobolt.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Growing Romaine Lettuce</h3>
            <div class="romaine-lettuce"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Crisphead lettuce, or head for short, is the lettuce we know as Iceberg. One of the most popular
                    types of lettuce, salad lovers all over the country often wonder how to grow Iceberg lettuce. </li>
                <li>Growing Iceberg lettuce requires a bit more care than other varieties.</li>
                <li>For the best results, plant head lettuce in your fall garden. By avoiding the warm summer weather,
                    you produce sweeter lettuce.</li>
                <li>In addition to Iceberg, Ithaca, Great Lakes and Crispivo are great head lettuce cultivars.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Growing Butterhead Lettuce</h3>
            <div class="butter-head-lettuce"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Butterhead lettuce varieties produce tightly folded heads of tender lettuce leaves.</li>
                <li>The middle leaves are often self-blanching to a delicate white color.</li>
                <li>Named after the subtle butter flavor, this mild lettuce adds a sweet touch to salads. Try Ermosa,
                    Esmeralda or Nancy in your lettuce garden.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How Long Does It Take Lettuce to Grow?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lettuce grows fairly quickly. Leaf varieties reach maturity in 30 days but can be harvested as soon
                    as they reach the desired size. Other types of lettuce require 6 to 8 weeks to reach full harvest
                    size.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Can you grow lettuce year ’round?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Garden zones with minimum temperatures in the 60s can grow lettuce all year round. Lettuce seeds
                    germinate in temperatures between 40 to 80 degrees F, depending on the cultivar.</li>
                <li> Active growth takes place when days are between 60 to 70 degrees. Warmer zones can grow lettuce
                    throughout the winter if you stick to planting lettuce in the fall.</li>
                <li> Other areas can use modifications, such as cold frames, row covers and greenhouses to extend the
                    growing season.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Can you grow lettuce in hot weather?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lettuce does not like hot weather. The plant panics and decides that it better produce seeds as
                    quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>Seed stems develop, and the plant begins diverting nutrients to seed production.</li>
                <li>This process, known as bolting, produces bitter lettuce.</li>
            </ol>
