          The lemon (Citrus limon) is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native
          to South
          Asia, primarily Northeast India.

          The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world,
          primarily for
          its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking.
          The
          juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The
          distinctive sour
          taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.
        </p>
        <div class="lemon-img"></div>
        <p>
          The true lemon tree reaches 10 to 20 ft (3-6 m) in height and usually has sharp thorns on the twigs. The
          alternate
          leaves, reddish when young, become dark-green above, light-green below; are oblong, elliptic or long-ovate, 2
          1/2 to 4
          1/2 in (6.25-11.25 cm) long, finely toothed, with slender wings on the petioles. The mildly fragrant flowers
          may be
          solitary or there may be 2 or more clustered in the leaf axils. Buds are reddish; the opened flowers have 4 or
          5 petals
          3/4 in (2 cm) long, white on the upper surface (inside), purplish beneath (outside), and 20-40 more or less
          united
          stamens with yellow anthers. The fruit is oval with a nipple-like protuberance at the apex; 2 3/4 to 4 3/4 in
          (7 -12 cm)
          long; the peel is usually light-yellow though some lemons are variegated with longitudinal stripes of green
          and yellow
          or white; it is aromatic, dotted with oil glands; 1/4 to 3/8 in (6-10 mm) thick; pulp is pale-yellow, in 8 to
          10
          segments, juicy, acid. Some fruits are seedless, most have a few seeds, elliptic or ovate, pointed, smooth,
          3/8 in (9.5
          mm) long, white inside.
        </p>
        <h3>WHERE TO GROW LEMON</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Locate lemon trees in well-draining spots in full sun. While these trees tolerate even very poor soil
            conditions well,
            they cannot endure wet feet.
          </li>
          <li>A soil pH range between 5.5 and 6.5 is ideal for lemons. Plant them in the highest areas of your property
            to avoid
            exposing them to cold air that accumulates in low spots.</li>
          <li>Citrus trees should be planted in sunny and wind-protected areas. In the citrus belt, trees can be planted
            at any
            time, however, spring is the best time for container-grown plants.</li>
          <li>Each citrus plant will need a good 6 to 8 feet of space between it.</li>
          <li>If your climate includes frosts and freezing temperatures, a container is best so you can bring your tree
            indoors during
            the winter.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="planting-img"></div>
        <h3>PLANTING</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Citrus trees should be planted in a sunny and wind-protected area.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the citrus belt, trees can be planted at any time, however, spring is the best time for container-grown
            plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard-size citrus trees should be spaced 12 to 25 feet apart and dwarf citrus trees should be set 6 to 10
            feet apart.
            The exact distance depends on the variety. The bigger the fruit, the farther the distance.
          </li>
          <li>If the soil is not well-drained, plant the trees on a slight mound to prevent waterlogging. Citrus needs a
            decent amount of moisture but doesn’t enjoy being water-logged, so be sure your soil retains water but
            doesn’t hold it in and create a soggy mess.</li>
          <li>
            You’ll want to dig a hole that is big enough to accommodate your tree’s root system, so the size of your
            hole will
            depend upon the size of your tree. However, a 2-foot wide hole is usually large enough. Dig to a depth that
            is equal to
            the container depth of the tree.
          </li>
          <li>
            To plant citrus trees inside from seeds, remove the seeds from the desired fruit. Soak the seeds overnight
            in water and plant them ½ inch deep in moist potting soil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the pot with a plastic bag or wrap and let it sit in a warm and sunny spot for a few weeks until the
            seeds start to grow. Then, remove the plastic but keep the pot near a
            warm and
            sunny window.
          </li>
          <li>
            Water your tree 2 to 3 times the first week, 2 times per week for the next few weeks, and then weekly
            thereafter. Aim
            for a deep soaking rather than a light sprinkling, but be prepared to give your tree a little more water if
            your area is
            having a hot spell or no rainfall.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>CARE</h3>
        <div class="site-img"></div>
        <ol>
          <li>A few weeks after planting, and for the first few years (before bearing age), feed the tree a balanced
            (such as 6-6-6) fertilizer. Learn more about soil amendments and preparing soil for planting.</li>
          <li>For newly bearing trees, provide nutrients to continue branch and leaf growth, but also to replace
            nutrients lost by fruit forming. A citrus blend is ideal.</li>
          <li>
            Check manufacturer’s directions, ask a garden nursery, or consult your local cooperative extension as to how
            often and how much fertilizer to apply during each year of a tree’s growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mulches are not recommended for citrus trees, but if trees are located in a cultivated plant bed where mulch
            is used, keep at least 12 inches of bare ground between the tree trunk and the mulch. Pre-emergent
            herbicides may be
            used to prevent weed seeds from germinating.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fruit thinning is unnecessary for citrus trees, as they typically experience something called the “June
            drop.”
            In late
            spring or early summer (May or June for most of the country), citrus trees naturally drop a number of their
            immature
            fruit.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>HARVEST/STORAGE</h3>
        <div class="container-img"></div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Depending on the climate, citrus fruits may take 6 to 8 months to ripen.
          </li>
          <li>Citrus fruits will not ripen off the tree, so refrain from picking them too early.</li>
          <li>
            The best indicator of ripeness is taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Harvest the fruit by cutting them off with pruning shears or by pulling the fruit stalk from the tree.
          </li>
          <li>Undamaged citrus fruits can be stored for several weeks at cool temperatures.</li>
        </ol>
