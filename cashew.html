                Cashew or originates from the Caribbean Islands and the North East of Brazil. But today it is grown in several other tropical parts of the world, mostly in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Cashew trees can grow up to 6-12 meters (20-40 feet) high. Its evergreen leaves are oval, leathery and dark green.
            </p>
            <div class="cashew-img"></div>
            <p>
                As for the fruits of this tree, do not be fooled by appearances. The cashew apple is oval-shaped, like bell pepper: yellow, orange, or red in color is a false fruit (it is also edible). The real fruit, more discreet is a nut attached to the end of the fake fruit. It is that which contains the edible kernel, which we called Cashew.
            </p>
            <h1> How to Grow a Cashew Tree from Seeds?</h1>
            <p>
                To propagate it from seeds, you will need a matured unshelled nut (seed). These seeds are viable for up to 4 months. If you have collected the fresh seed from the tree, dry it in the sun for 3 days and soak in water overnight before sowing. Sow the seeds in good quality seed starting mix; the seeds will germinate anywhere from 4 days to 3 weeks.
            </p>
            <h1>Requirements for Growing Cashew Nuts Tree</h1>
            <div class="cashew-tree-img"></div>
            <h3>Sun</h3>
            <div class="sun-img"></div>
            <P>
                Cashew tree needs at least 6 hours of direct sunlight. In the shade, it grows slowly and doesn’t produce fruits.
            </P>
            <h3>Soil</h3>
            <div class="soil-img"></div>
            <p>
                Cashew prefers poor sandy and laterite soil with a pH level of around 5-6.5. Never grow cashew tree in a clay-rich soil. It is heavy and encourages waterlogging, and in the case of a growing cashew tree, the soil you use should be well-drained in a way that water will flow smoothly.
            </p>
            <h3>Water</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <p>
                Cashew trees are moderately drought tolerant once established, but they produce more fruits if watered regularly. During the summer, water weekly or twice and deeply. Reduce or withhold watering during winter. Overwatering can harm or even kill your cashew tree, so water only if the soil is dry and let the soil to dry out between spells of watering.
            </p>
            <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
            <div class="fertilizer-img"></div>
            <p>
                Cashew tree needs regular application of fertilizer to thrive and produce fruits. Use slow-release fertilizer according to the product instructions given on the packet, around the base of the tree, every two months, during the growing season. Also apply compost or farm manure once in a year, around 30 pounds (15 kg) on the surface of the soil to a mature tree.
            </p>
            <h1>Cashew Tree Care</h1>
            <h3>Pruning</h3>
            <div class="pruning-img"></div>
            <p>
                Prune cashew trees regularly to remove weak, dead, and entangled branches and branches that are infested with diseases or pests. Also, cut overcrowded branches to promote vigorous growth.
            </p>
            <h3>Mulching</h3>
            <div class="mulching-img"></div>
            <p>
                Do mulching around your cashew tree with organic matters to prevent weeds and to conserve moisture.
            </p>
            <h3>Pests and Diseases</h3>
            <div class="pest-img"></div>
            <p>
                The cashew tree is generally pest-free if it is in good health. Major pests that attack it are tea mosquito, stem and root borer, leaf Miner, and blossom Webber.
            </p>
            <h1>Harvesting and Cashew Nut Processing</h1>
            <p>
                Harvest when cashew apples turn pink or red and cashew nut shells are gray. After harvesting, separate the cashew apple from the nut.
                <br><br>
                Cashew apple can be eaten raw or make juice of it. Unshelled cashew nut can be stored up to 2 years. Do not attempt to break the shell before roasting; cashew shell contains very caustic oil that can burn skin.
                <br><br>
                When processing cashew nut at home must wear gloves and safety glasses and take special care.
            </p>
