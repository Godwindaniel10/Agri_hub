          Capsicum, also known as red pepper or chili pepper, is an herb.
          Capsicum is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family
          Solanaceae, native to the Americas, cultivated worldwide for their
          chili pepper or bell pepper fruit. Capsicum are one of the easiest
          vegetables you can grow with minimal supplies and efforts.
        </p>
        <div class="capsicum-img"></div>
        <p>
          Despite being a single species, Capsicum has many forms with a variety
          of luscious colors like red, yellow, green, purple and even black.In
          addition to its use as spices and vegetables, Capsicum has also found
          use in medicines because of its excellent health benefits.
        </p>
        <h1>How to grow capsicum from seeds?</h1>
        <div class="capsicum-seed-img"></div>
        <p>
          Growing capsicums or bell peppers from seeds is by far the most
          inexpensive way to get hold of a bountiful harvest of fresh, juicy
          bell peppers.With a little bit of space, a good and solid container,
          enough fertilization and mulching will make growing chilies or
          capsicum in pots an easy venture.Capsicums will happily survive in
          containers if there is at least 25 cm depth of soil.
        </p>
        <h1>Climate and temperature for growing capsicum</h1>
        <div class="capsicum-tree-img"></div>
        <h3>Climate</h3>       
        <p>
          Capsicum prefers moderately low temperatures and dry season. Seed
          germinates best at the temperature range from 20 to 25◦C and grows
          best at 18 - 25◦C.
        </p>
        <h3>Soil</h3>      
        <p>
          Capsicum prefers poor sandy and laterite soil with a pH level of
          around 5-6.5. Never grow capsicum tree in a clay-rich soil. It is
          heavy and encourages waterlogging, and in the case of a growing
          capsicum tree, the soil you use should be well-drained in a way that
          water will flow smoothly.
        </p>
        <h3>Water</h3>        
        <p>
          Providing peppers with adequate water is essential from the moment the
          plants flower until the harvest. Deeply water the plants with 1 inch
          of water per week, and adjust the amount or frequency during hot, dry
          periods, after rainfall or if your soil is sandy and drains fast.
          Instead of flooding the soil with water when it's dry, keep it evenly
          moist. Drip irrigation is ideal for growing peppers, because it's
          economical, less labor intensive and delivers the water at the plant's
          roots without wetting the foliage and possibly triggering diseases.
        </p>
        <h3>Fertilizers</h3>
        <div class="fertilizer-img"></div>
        <p>
          Wait for the first set of true leaves to develop before applying
          fertilizer to the pepper seedlings. Doing this too soon can burn the
          young seedlings. Adding the right amount of nitrogen will stimulate
          stem and foliage growth so that your pepper plants will grow big
          enough to support several fruits each.
          Add your nitrogen fertilizer on this schedule: </br> Apply about 30 percent
          of the nitrogen as part of the pre-planting broadcast. </br> Two weeks after
          planting, add 45 percent of the nitrogen. </br> Save the last 25 percent for
          the final weeks as the pepper harvest is wrapping up.
        </p>
        <h3>Pests and Diseases</h3>
        <div class="pest-img"></div>
        <p>
          Capsicums are prone to get infected by pests and diseases easily. Most
          of the bugs can be either picked off manually or sprayed away with a
          mixture of detergent and water. If your plants start wilting and die
          unexpectedly even after receiving enough sunlight and water, there are
          chances that your plants are infected with a wilting disease. These
          diseases stay in the soil for a long time. To prevent this you should
          grow your capsicum in large pots or areas where no capsicums have been
          grown for a long time.
        </p>
        <h1>Harvesting</h1>
        <div class="harvest-img"></div>
        <p>
          The well-treated capsicum plants start bearing fruits within two
          months of planting. You can start harvesting your capsicums when they
          grow to the size of a tennis ball and the skin starts to look smooth
          and glossy. Even if you pluck them when they are not fully riped, they
          will ripen if kept at a place that receives sunlight. Cut the
          capsicums off the plants when they are riped.
        </p>
        <h1>Benefits of capsicum</h1>
        <p>
         Available in different colors, capsicum is used across the world in many different types of dishes. 
          The vegetable, which is also known as bell pepper, originated in tropical America and has been used 
          as a medicine because of its medicinal properties. It is low in fat and is a remedy for many diseases. 
          The vegetable is one of the best sources of carotenoids like beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and lutein. 
          It is also rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.
