                Beets are a cool-weather crop.Beets are biennial plants grown as annuals.Plant 5 to 10 beets per
                household member.

                They are grown for their swollen roots and also for their leaves. There are two main beet types:
                globe-shaped and long-rooted. Beetroots can be red, orange, gold, yellow, white, and even concentrically
                ringed roots. A rosette of large edible leaves sprouts from the root; green leaves can have red, yellow,
                or white veins.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Grow Beetroot</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Beetroot</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sow beets in the garden 2 to 3 weeks before the last average frost date in spring.</li>
                <li>The soil temperature should be at least 50°F (10°C), especially if you have experienced damping-off.
                </li>
                <li>Beets will grow faster in spring when covered with a row cover which will provide protection from
                    chilling temperatures and wind.</li>
                <li>Beets require 45 to 65 days to reach harvest.</li>
                <li>Beets can again be planted in late summer or early autumn 6 to 8 weeks before the first average
                    frost in autumn.</li>
                <li>This will be the fall and winter storage crop, so sow only once, planting as much as you will need
                    for winter.</li>
                <li>When direct sowing during summer, keep the soil constantly moist or germination will be poor.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Beetroot</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grow beets in full sun or partial shade in warm regions. Plant beets in well-worked loose soil rich
                    in organic matter.</li>
                <li>Be sure to remove all stones and clods from planting beds so as not to impede or split growing
                    roots.</li>
                <li>Add plenty of aged compost to growing beds in advance of planting, this will increase the yield.
                </li>
                <li>Alternatively, add 3 cups (700ml) of dried seaweed per 100 square feet (9 sq m).</li>
                <li>Beets grow best where the soil pH is 6.0 to 6.8; the ideal soil pH is 6.5.</li>
                <li>Add only aged manure to the soil, fresh manures are high in nitrogen and cause beetroots to fork,
                    twist, or be “hairy.”</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Beetroot</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Beets are grown from seed clusters about the size of a small pea. Each cluster contains several tiny
                    true seeds.</li>
                <li>Presoak seed clusters for 12 hours before sowing to help speed germination.</li>
                <li>Sow seed clusters 1 inch (2.5cm) deep and 1 inch apart.</li>
                <li>Seedlings will sprout in clumps.</li>
                <li>Use small scissors to thin successful seedlings to 4 to 6 inches (10-15cm) apart when seedlings are
                    3 inches tall.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can gently separate young seedlings and replant the extra seedlings in a row
                    nearby.</li>
                <li>Space rows 12 to 18 inches (30-45cm) apart. Add thinned seedlings to salads. Beets generally do not
                    transplant well.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Beetroot</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep beets evenly watered.</li>
                <li>Do not let the soil dry out.</li>
                <li>Lack of water will cause roots to become stunted, stringy, and tough.</li>
                <li>Add aged compost to planting beds in advance of seeding.</li>
                <li>Side dress beets with compost at midseason.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Check roots for boring insects.</li>
                <li>Leafminers can tunnel inside the leaf surface leaving gray streaks.</li>
                <li>Alternaria leaf spot is caused by various species of fungi in the Alternaria genus.</li>
                <li>If your plant has it, you’ll notice the leaves crinkling and curling inward.</li>
                <li>They may also be stunted, small, and discolored, with purple margins.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Beetroot</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Beets will reach harvestable size–1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.6cm) in diameter–40 to 80 days after sowing.
                </li>
                <li>Lift beets gently. Twist the leaves off rather than cutting them off to prevent juices from
                    bleeding.</li>
                <li>Baby beets are ready for harvest about 40 days after planting.</li>
                <li>Full-size beets will be ready about 2 to 3 weeks later.</li>
                <li>Roots about the size of a golf ball will have optimal flavor.</li>
                <li>‘Lutz Greenleaf’ variety will be flavorful when as large as a softball.</li>
                <li>Golden beets will be flavorful when the size of a baseball.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storing Beetroot</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Beets will keep in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 weeks.</li>
                <li>Beet greens will keep in the refrigerator in a plastic bag for up to 1 week.</li>
                <li>Beets will keep for 1 to 3 months in damp sawdust in a cold, moist place.</li>
                <li>Beets can be frozen and dried.</li>
                <li>For long-term storage, you can pack beets in containers of moist sand or peat and keep them in an
                    unheated basement or garage (40-50°F/4.5-10°C is ideal).</li>
                <li>beets will not store as long as larger beets.</li>
                <li>In cold-winter regions, you can store beets in an outdoor pit lined with dry leaves and straw.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Different Types of Beetroot</h3>
            <div class="beetroot-types"></div>
            <ol>
