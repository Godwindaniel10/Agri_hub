            <h1>HOW TO PLANT AND GROW SAGE</h1>
            <div class="sage-img"></div>
            <p>
                Whether you bought sage seedlings or started your own indoors, planting them in the right spot is key. Here’s what to do (and what not to do) at planting time.
            </p>
            <h3>WHEN TO PLANT SAGE</h3>
            <p>
                Seedlings are more susceptible to cold temperatures than established plants, so it’s best to plant sage after the danger of frost has passed in the spring.
                <br><br>
                More ornamental varieties like golden sage and pineapple sage are even more sensitive to frost, so wait until the soil temperatures have warmed a bit to plant these types.
            </p>
            <h3>WHERE TO PLANT SAGE</h3>
            <p>
                Sage needs lots of sun and well-drained soil to be at its best. Afternoon shade in zones 8 and up is usually okay, but otherwise make sure plants get full sun.
                <br><br>
                If you have clay soil, it’s best to amend it before planting sage to improve drainage. You can also make use of raised beds or containers. Just remember that soggy soil is one of the few things likely to kill sage plants.
                <br><br>
                Mix some compost into your soil before planting for extra nutrients, but don’t add any fertilizer beyond compost. Sage actually grows better in soil with low fertility.
            </p>
            <h3>SAGE PLANTING TIPS</h3>
            <div class="tips-img"></div>
            <p>
                Most varieties of sage grow 1-3’ tall and wide, although there are some dwarf cultivars available if you only have a small planting space. This means you’ll want to space most plants 18-24” apart to ensure they get good air circulation.
                <br><br>
                Sage makes a good companion plant for other Mediterranean herbs like thyme, oregano, and rosemary. It can also repel cabbage moths and the carrot rust fly, so plant it in or around your vegetable garden if you have one. Discover more about planting herbs together for a successful kitchen herb garden.
                <br><br>
                The one plant to keep sage away from is cucumber, which is sensitive to some of the aromatic chemicals sage gives off.
                <br><br>
                Once your seedlings are in the ground, be sure to water them if the weather is dry for the first few weeks while they get established.
            </p>
            <h1>CARING FOR SAGE PLANTS</h1>
            <div class="caring-img"></div>
            <p>
                Once planted and established, sage has few maintenance tasks. This herb prefers dry soil, so you won’t need to water mature plants unless they are grown in containers.
                <br><br>
                Sage becomes more and more woody as it ages. Woody sections don’t produce many leaves, so it’s best to prune some of them off in early spring.
                <br><br>
                Do your pruning after the danger of frost has passed but before plants put out a lot of new growth. Cut off about a third of each plant, clipping off woody stems where they meet a main stem to keep plants clean and healthy.
                <br><br>
                You can do a second pruning in midsummer after the plants have flowered, although this won’t be necessary if you’ve been harvesting frequently throughout the season.
                <br><br>
                If you live in a borderline zone (mainly zones 4 or 5), give your plants some extra protection over the winter by mulching them with straw, leaves, etc.
                <br><br>
                Sage can grow quite large but typically needs replaced every 4 or 5 years because productivity starts dropping. You can take cuttings from 3 or 4 year-old plants to easily propagate new sage without buying more plants.
                <br><br>
                A study pair of bypass pruners is best for pruning sage. Sage stems can be very tough and woody.
            </p>
            <h3>COMMON PESTS AND PROBLEMS</h3>
            <div class="pest-img"></div>
            <p>
                Sage repels most pests, although it can occasionally be bothered by insects like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites.
                <br><br>
                The biggest problem you might run into is root rot or fungal diseases caused by poor airflow, high humidity, and wet soil conditions. You can prevent this by spacing plants properly and ensuring that the soil drains well.
                <br><br>
                Healthy sage is so effective at repelling pests that it’s frequently used as a natural insect repellant. It’s one of the best plants for repelling fleas, for example.

            <h1>HOW TO HARVEST SAGE</h1>
            <div class="harvesting"></div>
            <p>
                Now that you know how to plant and grow sage, the last major step is harvesting!
                <br><br>
                You can harvest from your plants during their first year of growth but only lightly. Mature plants can be harvested more heavily as long as you leave about ½ of the plant intact.
                <br><br>
                New leaves on green shoots will be more tender and flavorful than leaves on woody sections, so pick these first. You can harvest anytime during the season, but the leaves are at their peak right before the plants bloom.
                <br><br>
                Harvest by either pinching off individual leaves as needed or clipping off whole sprigs of sage. Let plants recover for a few days after a major harvest, and stop picking leaves in the fall so that your plants can store up energy for the winter.
                <br><br>
                If you happen to live in a more mild climate where the leaves stay evergreen, you can harvest sage all year!
            </p>
            <h1>PRESERVING AND ENJOYING YOUR SAGE</h1>
            <div class="preserving-sage-img"></div>
            <p>
                The most traditional way to store sage is to dry it. Bundles of the leaves can be hung up to dry, or you can lay out individual leaves on a wire rack. The herb should be crisp and crumbly in a few weeks.
                <br><br>
                If you live somewhere humid (I do), use a dehydrator to dry your sage instead of hanging it. Hanging sage in a humid climate will lead to musty, mildewy leaves, not tasty ones. I own a basic Presto dehydrator that works fine for herbs on its lowest setting. My family has used an older model of the same dehydrator for about 20 years and it’s still working!
                <br><br>
                <strong>Store dried sage in airtight glass containers.</strong>
                <br><br>
                For the best flavor, keep the leaves whole and crumble right before you cook with them.
                <br><br>
                I store herbs in glass jars vacuum sealed with the jar sealer attachment for my Food Saver. Light can damage dry herbs – keep them somewhere dark and cool (if possible).
                <br><br>
                Another way to preserve the flavor of sage is by freezing it. Whole leaves and even whole stalks can be frozen in bags and taken out as needed.
                <br><br>
                However you choose to preserve or use your sage, it will have that fresh and powerful homegrown flavor, which is one of the major benefits of growing it in your own garden!
