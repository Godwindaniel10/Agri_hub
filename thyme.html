            <p><strong>Thyme</strong> is a wonderful herb with a pleasant, pungent, clover flavor. It smells like summer to us! There are both fragrant ornamental types as well as culinary thyme varieties which add a savory note to summer soups, grilled meats, and vegetables. Here’s how to plant and grow thyme.</p>
            <div class="thyme-img"></div>
            <p>
                A low-growing hardy perennial, thyme is a fragrant herb with small, fragrant leaves and thin, woody stems. The culinary varieties are evergreen.
                <br><br>
                Thyme comes in over fifty varieties with different fragrances and flavors. Fresh or English thyme are used most often in cooking.
                <br><br>
                Originally from the Mediterranean area, this herb is drought-friendly so it doesn’t have high watering needs. It is also pollinator-friendly! Let some thyme plants flower, since the herb attracts the bees.
                <br><br>
                While thyme is usually harvested in the summer months, we have harvested ours well into late fall!
                <br><br>
                Thyme can grow in the ground or in a container. Either is left outside in wintertime. New leaves will emerge within the early spring.
            </p>
            <h3>PLANTING</h3>
            <div class="planting-thyme-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Thyme thrives in full sun and loves heat. If you are growing in a pot indoors, plant near a sunny window.</li>
                <li>Soil needs to drain well so there aren’t “wet feet.” In the garden, plant with other drought-tolerant perennials.</li>
                <li>In early spring, you may fertilize with organic matter, like compost, but not much soil amendment is necessary.</li>
                <li>It’s hard to grow thyme from seeds because of slow, uneven germination. It’s easier to buy the plants from a garden center or take some cuttings from a friend. Over time, you can propagate from your own cuttings.</li>
                <li>For a head start, plant the cuttings indoors 6 to 10 weeks before the last spring frost.</li>
                <li>Plant cuttings or young thyme plants any time after the ground temperature reaches 70°F. This is usually 2 to 3 weeks before the last spring frost in well-drained soil about 9 inches apart. </li>
                <li>Space young plants 12 to 24 inches apart, depending upon the specific variety.</li>
                <li>The plants should grow 6 to 12 inches in height.</li>
                <li>In the garden, plant thyme near cabbage or tomatoes. </li>
                <li>If you are growing thyme in containers, plant with rosemary which also likes sunny conditions and has similar watering needs.</li>
            </ol>
                <h1>CARE</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Water deeply only when the soil is completely dry.</li>
                    <li>Prune the plants back in the spring and summer to contain the growth.</li>
                    <li>If you have cold winters, remember to lightly mulch around the plants after the ground freezes.</li>
                    <li>Three to four year old plants need to be divided or replaced because older plants are woody and the leaves less flavorful.</li>
                    <li>You can take some cuttings and plant them indoors in pots, too</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>How to Take a Cutting:</h3>
                <p>
                    Clip a three-inch cutting from the very tip of a stem, apply rooting hormone on the exposed portion of the stem, and plant it in either sterile sand or vermiculite. Roots will emerge within about six weeks. Transfer to a small pot, let the root ball form, and then transfer to a large pot or directly to your garden.
                </p>
                <h3>PESTS/DISEASES</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gray mold</li>
                    <li>Root rot</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>HARVEST/STORAGE</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Harvest thyme just before the plant flowers by cutting off the top five to six inches of growth. Leave the tough, woody parts.</li>
                    <li>It’s best to harvest thyme in morning after the dew has dried. Clean leaves should not be washed, because it removes some of the essential oils. </li>
                    <li>Two or more crops may be gathered during the season.</li>
                    <li>Or, if you keep trimming your thyme plant, it will keep growing (and also keep a compact shape). But always leave at least five inches of growth so plant will continue to thrive.</li>
                    <li>Trim thyme whenever it gets leggy.</li>
                    <li>Fresh thyme should be stored refrigerated and wrapped lightly in plastic; it should last one to two weeks</li>
                    <li>To dry thyme, hang the sprigs in a dark, well-ventilated, warm area. You can also just dry the leaves by placing them on a tray. Once dried, store them in an airtight container. Crush just before using. Under good conditions herbs, will retain maximum flavor for two years. </li>
                    <li>Freezing is another method of storage.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>VARIETIES</h3>
                <p>The three most common varieties of culinary thyme are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lemon thyme, for a hint of lemon</li>
                    <li>French or English thyme (most common)</li>
                    <li>Caraway thyme, for a nice fragrance of caraway and thyme</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="cooking-img"></div>
                <p>
                    Thyme adds a gentle flavor to just about anything, especially eggs, tomatoes, meats, soups, beans, and potatoes.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s taste has been described as a bit earthy with lemony and minty tones. Some thing it has a slight floral flavor.
                    <br><br>
                    Fresh thyme can be used with or without its stem. However, if a recipe calls for a “sprig,” the stem should be left on. The leaves will fall off in cooking, and then the stem can be removed prior to serving.  
                    <br><br>
                    If a recipe calls for a “sprig” of thyme, the leaves and stem should be used together, intact. When adding a whole sprig of thyme to soups, stews or other recipes, the leaves usually fall off during cooking and the woody stem can be removed prior to serving.
