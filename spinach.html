                Spinach is a cool-season annual. Plant spinach before the weather warms in spring and again as the weather cools in early autumn.
                Spinach doesn’t grow well during long hot summer days or in wet weather. Spinach does best when growing in moist, nitrogen-rich soil. Spinach plants form a deep taproot.

            <p>
                Spinach is one of the most satisfying cool-weather crops to grow, producing large yields of vitamin-rich, 
                dark green leaves that are excellent for salads and for cooking. Since both hot weather and long days trigger 
                spinach to bolt (send up a seed stalk) quickly, the secret to success with this crop is to start sowing seeds as 
                soon as possible in spring; to make small, 
                frequent plantings during late spring and summer, and to concentrate on fall as the season for the main crop.

            <h1>How to Grow Spinach</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Spinach</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spinach is a cool-season annual. It needs 6 weeks of cool weather from seed sowing to harvest.</li>
                <li>Spinach grows best when planted outdoors in early spring and then again in autumn. In mild-winter regions grow spinach outdoors in winter.</li>
                <li>Sow spinach indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last average frost date in spring for transplanting out as early as 4 weeks before the last frost. However, seedlings may suffer transplant shock if the roots are disturbed at transplant time.</li>
                <li>Direct sow spinach outdoors or set out transplants 4 weeks before the last average frost date.</li>
                <li>In mild-winter regions, plant spinach in late summer or early autumn for harvest in autumn or winter, sow spinach for autumn harvest 6 to 8 weeks before the first fall frost.</li>
                <li>Spinach can be grown through the winter everywhere in a cold frame or plastic tunnel.</li>
                <li>Spinach started in autumn can survive the winter under thick mulch; plants will resume growing in the spring.</li>
                <li>Plant succession crops of spinach every 10 to 14 days.</li>
                <li>Don’t grow spinach through the summer in hot summer regions. Instead, grow New Zealand spinach or Malabar spinach which are heat tolerant.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Spinach</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grow spinach in full sun. Grow spinach in partial shade in warm regions.</li>
                <li>Plant spinach in well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Add two inches of aged compost or a commercial organic planting mix to the planting beds before planting then turn the soil to 12 inches (30cm) deep.</li>
                <li>Spinach prefers a soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8.</li>
                <li>Spinach is hardy and thrives in cool weather; ideal spinach growing weather is 50°F to 70°F (10-21°C).</li>
                <li>Warm weather and long days will cause spinach to bolt—that is it will flower and go to seed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Spinach</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
               <li>Refrigerate seeds 1 week before sowing to help germination.</li>
               <li>Plant spinach seed ½ inch (12mm)deep. Cover seed lightly with soil.</li>
               <li>Sow seed 2 to 4 inches (5-10cm) apart.</li>
               <li>Space rows 12 to 14 inches (30-35cm) apart.</li>
               <li>Spinach seed will germinate in 5 to 9 days at 70°F (21°C) Germination will take longer if the soil is cooler, about 21 days at 50°F (10°C).</li>
               <li>Thin spinach to 12 inches (30cm) apart when seedlings are 3 inches (7cm). Thin to the strongest seedlings. Remove weak seedlings by cutting them off at the soil level with scissors.</li>
               <li>Grow 15 plants per household member.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Spinach</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep the soil evenly moist throughout the growing season to grow spinach quickly.</li>
                <li>Avoid splashing muddy water onto leaves, mulch around plants with straw or chopped leaves to avoid getting soil on leaves.</li>
                <li>Side dress plants with compost tea or a dilute solution of fish emulsion every two weeks during the growing season.</li>
                <li>Side dress spinach with aged compost at midseason.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Spinach can be attacked by aphids, flea beetles, leafminers, slugs, and spider mites.</li>
                <li>Knock aphids off plants with a strong blast of water. Pinch out heavily infested foliage.</li>
                <li>Remove leaves in which leafminers are tunneling-. Look for the eggs on the underside of the leaves. Floating row covers can exclude leafminer flies from the planting bed.</li>
                <li>Spinach is susceptible to mildew, rust, and mosaic virus.</li>
                <li>Mildew and rust are fungal diseases. Spray-mist leaves with compost tea to prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                <li>Plants hit by mosaic virus should be removed from the garden. Mosaic virus will cause leaves to be mottled or streaked white or yellow.</li>
                <li>Keep the garden clean of debris. Remove and destroy diseased plants.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Spinach</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Spinach leaves can be harvested as soon as they are big enough to eat.</li>
                <li>Cut leaves 4 to 7 inches (10-17cm) long from plants that have 6 to 8 leaves. Cut the older outer leaves first. Allow the remaining young leaves to grow on to maturity.</li>
                <li>If you harvest all of the leaves from a plant, cut the leaves 3 inches (7cm) above the soil; new leaves will grow on for a second harvest.</li>
                <li>Very large leaves and older leaves can be bitter; harvest leaves sooner rather than later.</li>
                <li>Lengthening days (days longer than 14 hours) and warming weather (temperatures greater than 75°F/24°C) will cause spinach to bolt, flower, and set seed. Bolting will mark the end of the harvest.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storing Spinach</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash spinach thoroughly to eliminate the grit that sometimes sticks to crinkled leaves.</li>
                <li>Spinach can be refrigerated for up to one week.</li>
                <li>Spinach can be frozen canned or dried.</li>
                <li>Spinach seeds can be sprouted.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Different Types of Spinach</h3>
            <div class="spinach-types"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>‘America’ (52 days): mostly heat and drought tolerant.</li>
                <li>‘Bloomsdale Long Standing’ (43 days): crinkled leaves, mosaic virus tolerant.</li>
                <li>‘Giant Noble’ (45 days): resistant to mosaic virus.</li>
                <li>‘Tyee’ (37-53 days): resistant to downy mildew.</li>
            </ol>
