            <p>Fish farming or pisciculture involves commercial breeding of fish, usually for food, in fish tanks or artificial enclosures such as fish ponds. It is a particular type of aquaculture, which is the controlled cultivation and harvesting of aquatic animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and so on, in natural or pseudo-natural environment.
                <br><br>
                A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery. Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, catfish, salmon and tilapia.

            <div class="fish-img"></div>
            <p>
                Global demand is increasing for dietary fish protein, which has resulted in widespread overfishing in wild fisheries, resulting in significant decrease in fish stocks and even complete depletion in some regions. Fish farming allows establishment of artificial fish colonies that are provided with sufficient feeding, protection from natural predators and competitive threats, access to veterinarian service, and easier harvesting when needed, while being separate from and thus do not usually impact the sustainable yields of wild fish populations. While fish farming are practised worldwide, China alone provides 62% of the world's farmed fish production. As of 2016, more than 50% of seafood was produced by aquaculture. In the last three decades, aquaculture has been the main driver of the increase in fisheries and aquaculture production, with an average growth of 5.3 percent per year in the period 2000–2018, reaching a record 82.1 million tonnes in 2018.
                <br><br>
                Farming carnivorous fish such as salmon, however, does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries, as such farmed fish are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish. The 2008 global returns for fish farming recorded by the FAO totaled 33.8 million tonnes worth about US$ 60 billion.

            <p>
                Fish farming may range from ‘backyard’ subsistence ponds to large scale industrial enterprises. Farming systems can be expressed in terms of input levels.
                <br><br>
                Extensive fish farming: In extensive fish farming, inputs such as economic and labour are usually low. The type of feed employed is natural fish. The system’s productivity is relatively low. Fertilizers are used to increase fertility and thus fish production.
                <br><br>
                Semi-Intensive fish farming: This involves higher labour and feed costs, as well as higher fish yields, compared to the extensive fish farming method. It requires a moderate level of inputs and fish production is increased by the use of fertilizer
                <br><br>
                Intensive fish farming: This type of fish farming method involves a high level of inputs and stocking the ponds with as many fish as possible. The type of fish feed employed here is the supplementary feed, while natural feed plays a minor role.

        <h1>Factors to consider when starting a fish farming business</h1>
        <p><strong>Registration of Business</strong></p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Whenever one decides to start a business, registering the business is the first thing to do. It saves one from a lot of legal issues when one registers the company.
            <br><br>
            Registering a company, in simple terms, means letting the government know you now own a business and that your business name is yours.
            <br><br>
            In some countries, the Corporate Affairs Commission is the Agency authorized by the Company and Allied Matters Act 1990 to register businesses.
            <br><br>
            Since fish is a major source of export in Nigeria, it is also important to register as an exporter.
            <br><br>
            If you are considering exporting fish from Nigeria, you will be required to register with the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC). Registration as an exporter can only be done using the e-registration platform. The page contains all the required information needed to obtain an Exporter’s Certificate.
        </p>
        <h3>Guidelines & procedures</h3>
        <p>There are documents required for completing the registration process. The documents depend on the type of company involved in the export process.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Post-Incorporation requirements for a fish farming business</h1>
        <p>Below are some requirements expected of a fish farm owner.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Business Entity Concept</h3>
        <p>
            According to the business entity concept, every business is considered to be separate and distinct from its owners. Business transactions are recorded in the books of accounts from the business point of view and not owners.
            <br><br>
            Owners being separate from the business are considered creditors of the business to the extent of their capital.
        </p>
        <h3>Keeping a Separate Bank Account</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most important things a newly incorporated company should do is to open a bank account for their business. Most business owners make the mistake of using a personal bank account for their business.
            <br><br>
            Having a separate account for your business will enable you to easily separate your business and personal expenses, which will help you reconcile your accounts when it’s time to complete your annual returns.
            <br><br>
            Separate own account from the business account.
        </p>
        <h3>Tax Registration</h3>
        <p>
            A company incorporated in some counries is required to be registered with the relevant tax authorities for tax purposes. Following the incorporation of a company, a Tax Payer Identification Number (TIN) is automatically generated for the new company. This TIN is to be used when remitting taxes due to the Federal Government. Taxes imposed by State Governments require separate taxpayer registration.
        </p>
        <h3>Filing of Annual Returns</h3>
        <p>
            The Annual Returns of a company is a yearly statement which gives essential information about a firm’s composition, activities, and financial position, and which must be filed by every active incorporated firm with an appropriate authority.
            <br><br>
            In some countries, it is a statutory requirement that all duly registered businesses and companies submit their annual returns yearly to the CAC.
            <br><br>
            New companies may not file its return within the first 18 months of its incorporation, while for older companies, the annual return is due no later than 42 days after its Annual General Meeting. Section 374 CAMA.
        </p>
        <h3>For Business Names</h3>
        <p>
            Partnerships, Business Ventures and all other types of organizations registered as Business Names need not submit Annual Returns for their first year of operation after registration. For subsequent years, however, the business is required to file its Annual Returns and make payments of the applicable fees on or before the 30th day of June of each year.
            <br><br>
            Very vital importance is that filing of the annual return by a company helps to keep the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) aware that such company is still actively in operation and still engaging in business activities or otherwise.

        </p>
        <h3>Keep Records</h3>
        <p>
            Keeping good records is vital for any business. Whether it’s to help manage your costs, whether it’s for legal, regulatory or tax purposes, or simply to help manage and improve your business.  Collecting, storing and effectively analyzing your data is vital.
        </p>
        <h3>Obtain Necessary Permits</h3>
        <p>It’s always necessary to get one’s business registered with a related body. This is because most businesses are supervised by associations. Often, there are fees to be paid before becoming a member of these associations.</p>
        <h3>Land / Site Selection</h3>
        <p>
            The importance of land cannot be overemphasized when it comes to agriculture.
            <br><br>
            The type of pond to be used for fish farming goes a long way in determining the land selection.
            <br><br>
            For earthen ponds, factors such as Flood history, environment, soil type, soil texture and soil composition should be considered when setting up a fish pond. The land to be used for fish farming should be free from harmful activities such as; pollution, industrial waste and domestic waste. Factor such as the source of water is also considered.
            <br><br>
            Coastal areas and the areas near rivers and stream are suitable for establishing fish farming businesses.
        </p>
        <h3>Aquarium or fish tank or pond</h3>
        <p>Fishpond is a great alternative to natural water reservoirs. With the construction of a fishpond, fish farming can be in a controllable environment.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>There are different types of fish ponds available to a fish farmer such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earthen Pond: Earthen ponds are mainly constructed from soil materials</li>
            <li>Concrete Pond: concrete ponds are the type of ponds wherein blocks are used to construct the pond above the ground level, using cement, gravel and sand. Concrete ponds are used for intensive fish farming. Concrete walls eliminate erosion due to currents caused by mechanical aeration, waves generated by the wind and fish activities.</li>
            <li>Fibre Pond: This is a type of pond also known as a plastic fish pond. It is constructed by carving a tank out of a full tank. One advantage this type of pond has over the other types of the pond is that it can be moved from one place to another.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            One needs to engage the services of a pond construction engineer and also ensure that the plumbing work is properly done to ensure proper drainage.
        </p>
        <h3>Water Pump</h3>
        <p>
            The use of a water pump is to ensure the fishes have adequate freshwater by filling the ponds, or tanks with fresh water from the source.
            <br><br>
            They also came in handy when you choose to drain the ponds at the end of the growing cycle.
        </p>
        <h3>Aeration Devices</h3>
        <p>
            Aeration is of vital importance in fish farming. Water quality is vital to the financial health and productivity of fish farming. Aeration devices are to ensure an adequate supply of oxygen to the fish. Aeration devices also make it easier to recycle water after removing impurities
        </p>
        <h3>Net or Seine Reels</h3>
        <p>Nets and seine reels are a large wall of netting deployed around an entire area or school of fish. The seine reels and nets are used in harvesting fish from the pond or river as the case may be.</p>
        <h3>Handling and Grading Equipment</h3>
        <p>Handling and grading equipment is used to grade and separate fish according to their sizes.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Two types of fish grading equipment are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manual fish graders: Manual fish graders are made of boxes that are fitted with different sized screens, each relating to a range of physical fish size. It allows small fishes to go through the screen while retaining the larger ones in the box.</li>
            <li>Mechanical fish graders: Mechanical fish graders is a machine that is used in grading fish into different size.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Water Testing Kit</h3>
        <p>
            Water testing kit is a must-have item in fish farming. Water testing kits are used to measure important parameters in aquaculture. Some testing methods use reagents and colour discs to make a visual determination of the parameter concentration. Other testing methods use reagents and titration procedures to measure parameter concentration. Water quality parameters such as; Dissolved oxygen, temperature level and pH are monitored and kept at acceptable ranges to achieve the best results in fish farming.
        </p>
        <h3>Source of water</h3>
        <p>
            Adequate water supply is essential for the success of a fish farm and lack of it may result in disaster because water needs to be changed at regular interval. Naturally available sources of water such as borehole and river water are the most suitable. However, rainwater and water from a chemically treated source like tap water are not recommended for fish farming.
        </p>
        <h3>Water Tank</h3>
        <p>
            This is to serve as a water reservoir from which water is supplied to the ponds. The water tank is connected to the fish ponds through a plumbing system to make it convenient for water to flow into the ponds when needed.
        </p>
        <h3>Fingerlings</h3>
        <p>
            The life cycle of a fish starts with an egg. The egg hatches into what is called a yolk sac. The larva stage begins when the fish has absorbed the yolk and starts feeding for itself. The fry is the development stage of fish immediately after the larva stage. When the fish gets bigger and looks very much like an adult, it is considered a fingerling.
            <br><br>
            The fingerling is the development stage of fish following the fry stage and continuing into the first three to four months of life. There is also the yearling which is the development stage of fish following the fingerling stage and lasting until approximately one year of age. The development stage of a fish after fingerling is what we refer to as juvenile. The best practice if one is starting a fish farming business is to buy either fingerlings or juveniles as this will save you from the headaches of mortality. There are fish farmers that specialize in hatching fingerlings and selling juveniles. It is important to get your fingerlings and juveniles from reputable fish hatcheries.  Once the fish matures and can reproduce and lay eggs, it becomes an adult.
        </p>
        <h3>Fish Feeds</h3>
        <p>
            An important part of the commercial fish farming business is feeding. Farmers should ensure they provide fishes with high quality and nutritious feeds. High quality feeds not only ensures maximum production, but it also helps to keep the fish healthy. Fish feeds occur in the form of granules or pellets. They provide the nutrition to fishes in a stable and concentrated form, enabling the fish to feed efficiently and grow to their full potential.  Fish feeds are combined with other ingredients like vegetable proteins, cereal grains, vitamins and minerals and formed into feed pellets.
            <br><br>
            There are different types of fish feeds available to fish farmers namely:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Natural Fish Feed: This is found naturally in the pond. This include; detritus, bacteria, plankton, worms, insects, snails, aquatic plants and fish (yes, fish eat fish if they`re hungry). Natural fish feeds are naturally in the pond. They may include bacteria, plankton, worms, insects, snails, aquatic plants, molluscs and smaller fishes. Variety of natural fish feeds are found in water bodies. Their presence depends on the productivity of the water body.</li>
            <p><strong>The demand for natural food varies from species to species and between the age group of fishes. Natural fish feeds have high protein and fat content, which promote the growth of fishes.</strong></p>
            <li>Supplementary Fish Feed: This usually includes cheap materials locally available such as terrestrial plants, maize, bone powder, kitchen wastes or agricultural by-products.</li>
            <li>Complete Fish Feed: Complete fish feeds are made from a mixture of carefully selected ingredients to provide all the nutrients necessary for the fish to grow well. They are made by experts who understand the perfect formula for the fish at a different stage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Harvesting</h3>
        <p>
            After a while, the fishes become suitable for harvesting. Harvesting of fishes depends on the fish species. Harvesting is done when a sizeable number of fish reach the marketing age. Harvesting of fish id done by the aid of nets or by draining water from the pond. Harvesting should be done when in the morning or late afternoon when the temperature is low.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Harvested fishes can be sold as:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
