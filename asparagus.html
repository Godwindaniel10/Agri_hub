                Asparagus is the first sign of Spring in many vegetable gardens.
                Stalks or spears begin to break the soil in early spring as soon as the soil temperature reaches 50°F
                (10°C).
            </p>
            <div class="asparagus-img"></div>
            <p>
                Asparagus is a perennial vegetable that requires three to four years to become established and
                productive. Once established, an asparagus plant can produce spears for 15 to 20 years or more.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Grow Asparagus</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Asparagus</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>You can grow asparagus from seeds, crowns (roots), or transplants.</li>
                <li>Start seed indoors 12 to 14 weeks before the last frost.</li>
                <li>Transplant seedlings or plants into the garden after the last frost.</li>
                <li>Plant asparagus seeds or crowns in the garden in early spring as soon as the soil is workable. The
                    soil temperature should be 50°F (10°C) or warmer.</li>
                <li>Allow asparagus 3 years to establish its roots before you begin harvesting.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Asparagus</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Asparagus is a perennial. Plant asparagus in a spot where plants can grow undisturbed and productive
                    for 15 to 20 years.</li>
                <li>Plant asparagus in full sun where it gets plenty of air circulation; this will help prevent disease.
                    Asparagus can tolerate partial shade.</li>
                <li>Plant asparagus out of prevailing winds; wind can damage or break stalks.</li>
                <li>Asparagus grows best in loose, compost-rich well-drained soil. Sandy loam is good soil for growing
                    asparagus.</li>
                <li>Add 3 to 4 inches (7-10cm) of aged compost to the planting bed and turn it under to 12 inches (30cm)
                    deep or more before planting asparagus.</li>
                <li>Plant in raised beds if your native soil is poor or constantly wet.</li>
                <li>A soil pH between 6.5 and 7.5 is best for growing asparagus.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Asparagus</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Asparagus plants grown from seed are less susceptible to transplant shock than those started from
                    crowns.</li>
                <li>Asparagus plant started from seed will be more productive over the course of its life than a plant
                    started from a crown.</li>
                <li>Sow seed 8 to 10 weeks before you plan to set transplants in the garden.</li>
                <li>Soak seed in compost tea for 5 to 10 minutes before planting; this will help reduce disease
                    problems.</li>
                <li>Sow seed 1½ inch (3.8cm) deep in a seed-starting mix or light potting soil. Sow seeds in individual
                    containers.</li>
                <li>Seeds will germinate in 7 to 21 days at 75°F (24°C).</li>
                <li>Place seedlings in a cold frame, plastic tunnel, or greenhouse to grow on until outdoor temperatures
                    are warm enough for transplanting.</li>
                <li>The optimal growing temperature is 60° to 70°F (15-21°C).</li>
                <li>Male plants produce more spears than female plants. You can cull out female plants by looking at the
                    flowers.</li>
                <li>Female flowers have three-lobed pistils; male flowers are larger and longer than female flowers.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Asparagus</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep asparagus planting beds evenly moist but not wet throughout the growing season.</li>
                <li>Mature plants can survive without extra watering, but the stalks may become stringy and woody.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Asparagus beetles may attack asparagus, especially in commercial asparagus growing districts.</li>
                <li>Asparagus beetles and larvae chew spear in spring and feed on fronds in summer.</li>
                <li>Pick off and destroy asparagus beetles or spray with insecticidal soap or pyrethrins.</li>
                <li>Asparagus is generally disease-free.</li>
                <li>Fungal diseases such as rust and fusarium wilt can attack asparagus. Spray-mist plants with compost
                    tea to prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                <li>Treat seed to prevent disease before planting; soak the seed in a one part</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Asparagus</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin the asparagus harvest when plants are three years old and fully developed.</li>
                <li>Pick spears for only two weeks the third year (which is the first harvest); let plants continue to
                    establish themselves; over-harvesting can weaken plants and cause future harvests to be small.</li>
                <li>The fourth year after planting, extend the harvest to 4 weeks.</li>
                <li>Every year after the fourth year, you can extend the harvest by a week or two until you are
                    harvesting up to 8 weeks.</li>
                <li>Cut spears when they are 6 to 10 inches (15-25cm) tall and at least the diameter of a pencil. Tips
                    should be firm and closed.</li>
                <li>Snap spears off at soil level with your fingers at or just below ground level. If you use a knife,
                    be careful not to injure nearby crowns.</li>
                <li>When spear bracts begin to feather out, it is too late to eat them.</li>
                <li>If temperatures approach 90°F (32°C) at harvest time, harvest daily; heat can cause bracts to open
                    prematurely.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storing Asparagus</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Asparagus is best used fresh.</li>
                <li>Asparagus will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator. Place spear upright in an inch or so of
                    water and refrigerate.</li>
                <li>Freeze asparagus after blanching.</li>
            </ol>
