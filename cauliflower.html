                Cauliflower is a cool-weather crop that requires 55 to 100 days of cool, even temperatures to reach
                harvest. Plant 1 to 2 plants per household member.

                Cauliflower is a cool-weather half-hardy biennial grown as an annual. Cauliflower is grown for its
                edible buds which form a solid head atop single stalks. Heads are sometimes called curds. Heads can be
                cream, white, purple, or green colored. Broccoflower is a hybrid cross between cauliflower and broccoli;
                broccoflower have green heads.

            <h1>How to Grow Cauliflower</h1>
            <h3>When to Plant Cauliflower</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cauliflower requires 55 to 100 days of cool, even temperatures to reach harvest.</li>
                <li>Start cauliflower seed indoors 6 to 10 weeks before the last frost in spring.</li>
                <li>Cauliflower germinates at 45°F (7°C). (Cauliflower is usually grown from transplants.)</li>
                <li>Transplants can go into the garden 2 to 6 weeks before the last frost, usually 6 weeks after sowing
                    when plants have 4 to 5 true leaves.</li>
                <li>Direct seed cauliflower into the garden where the soil temperature is between 65°F and 75°F
                    (18-24°C) and the weather will remain cool.</li>
                <li>Crops for a fall harvest can be direct-seeded 8 to 12 weeks before the first expected frost in fall.
                </li>
                <li>Cauliflower does not like extremes of temperature, hot or cold it does not tolerate dry conditions.
                </li>
                <li>Plant cauliflower in autumn for a winter harvest where winters are mild and frost-free.</li>
                <li>Extreme temperatures will cause cauliflower to bolt and go to seed.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="planting-img"></div>
            <h3>Where to Plant Cauliflower</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cauliflower grows best in rich, well-drained, moisture-retentive soil with a pH within the 6.5 to
                    8.0 range.</li>
                <li>Plant cauliflower in full sun.</li>
                <li>Broccoflower prefers partial shade.</li>
                <li>Add aged compost to planting beds before planting.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Plant Cauliflower</h3>
            <div class="site-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Sow cauliflower seeds ½ inch deep and 2 to 3 inch (2.5-7.6cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Thin plants to 15 to 24 inches (38-61cm) apart space rows 24 to 30 inches (61-76cm) apart.</li>
                <li>Set leggy or cooked-stemmed transplants deeply, up to their first leaves, so that they will not grow
                    top-heavy.</li>
                <li>For succession crops, plant a couple of heads at a time or plant early and midseason varieties at
                    the same time.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Water Requirements for Cauliflower</h3>
            <div class="water-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Cauliflower requires evenly moist soil for uninterrupted, vigorous growth and head formation.</li>
                <li>Do not let the ground dry out.</li>
                <li>Add aged compost to the planting bed before planting and as a side dressing again at midseason.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Protecting Against Disease and Pests</h3>
            <div class="disease-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Cauliflower can be attacked by cutworms, cabbage loopers (preceded by small yellow and white moths),
                    and imported cabbage worms.</li>
                <li>These pests can be controlled by fine mesh row covers, handpicking, and spraying with Bacillus
                    thuringiensis.</li>
                <li>Cauliflower is susceptible to root rots–an initial symptom is the yellowing leaves.</li>
                <li>Plant disease-resistant varieties, keep the garden free of debris, and avoid handling plants when
                    they are wet.</li>
                <li>Remove and destroy infected plants immediately so they cannot spread the disease to healthy plants.
                </li>
                <li>Downy mildew which occurs in cool, wet conditions can cause cauliflower head to brown.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How to Harvest Cauliflower</h1>
            <div class="harvest-img"></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Time from planting to harvest is 55 to 100 days for cauliflower grown from transplants 85 to 130
                    days for cauliflower grown from seed.</li>
                <li>Under good growing conditions, the heads develop rapidly to about six to eight inches in diameter.
                </li>
                <li>The mature head should be compact, firm, and white. Cut the whole head from the main stem.</li>
                <li>The leaves can be cooked like collards or cabbage.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storing Cauliflower</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cauliflower will keep for one week in the refrigerator unwashed and wrapped in plastic.</li>
                <li>Cauliflower can be frozen, pickled.</li>
            </ol>
